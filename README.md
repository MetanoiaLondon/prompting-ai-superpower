# Prompting AI Superpower

In November 2022, a momentous event occurred when OpenAI introduced ChatGPT, a revolutionary AI Chatbot. This groundbreaking release unveiled the remarkable progress achieved by AI researchers around the globe. Within a matter of days, one million users eagerly embraced ChatGPT, and within just six months, this number surged to an astonishing 100 million users. What captivated the world was its remarkable ability to respond to queries and commands, a feature aptly termed 'Prompting.'
ChatGPT's prowess stemmed from its extensive training on the entire accessible Internet and a multitude of other resources. Its knowledge base was nothing short of extraordinary, revealing unexpected emergent properties. Eminent leaders in the IT industry even suggested it exhibited signs of sentience. Consequently, tech titans, including OpenAI, implored governments to implement regulations. The media lent credence to growing concerns that future Generative AI, like GPTs, could pose existential threats to humanity. Strategy firms and governmental policy units united in predicting that up to 40% of work in advanced economies could either be automated or significantly enhanced by such Generative AI technologies. Governments are taking steps, but the pace of development and the explosion of technological advancements continue unabated.
This workshop, led by Dr. Alan Warr, is centered around the remarkable world of Prompting AI. The architects behind the Foundation LLMs, which power these ChatBots, have infused remarkable sophistication into how they respond to prompts. Currently, consultants and professionals employ them in a somewhat rudimentary manner. However, the potential of Prompting AI extends far beyond basic conversational inquiries and impressive outputs. From crafting advanced prompts to navigating agents and personal LLM applications, there exists a wealth of untapped potential in this domain.

Through a series of engaging demonstrations and insightful context, Dr. Alan Warr will commence with the fundamentals of AI prompting and progressively elevate the sophistication level. The use cases presented will be highly relevant to consultancy and similar professional spheres. Ultimately, Dr. Warr will shed light on recent opportunities for professionals and teams to develop LLM-powered applications that harness their internal knowledge and data. This is a trend that major consultancy firms are actively pursuing, both for their own benefit and that of their clients.

Agenda:
1.	Introduction to Generative AI, foundation LLMs, Chat GPTs and AI Prompting 
2.	Basic Prompting – one-shot, role, agent, chain of thought, etc.
3.	Advanced Prompting – 
4.	Embedded Prompting – Co-pilots
5.	Prompt-Enabled Applications – Retrieval Augmented Generation
6.	Further Opportunities – Local LLM apps, LLM Fine Tuning, GPT Agents
7.	GenAI & Prompting AI as a Strategic Imperative
8.	
The workshop features Python examples, but no prior coding experience is required. Participants can easily follow along, even during these coding segments.

This workshop is tailored for general consultancy and business professionals who are new to this field and eager to harness the power of Prompting AI as their new superpower. It is not intended for AI practitioners, as it offers introductory content rather than advanced topics.
